Welcome to my blog!

I'm an MIT Zoom 2022 majoring in computer science with a minor
in management and a concentration in Mandarin Chinese. For more information about me,
check out the about me page!


I want to write a blog to share technical experiences I thought were interesting. The goal is
to write what I would want to read with the caveat that my technical writing skills are
still under development. I plan to start off with my experience designing a social media and payment platform,
as well as my experience in the technical and business sides of mobile app development. Stay tuned!


Coffee til beer,
Gannon

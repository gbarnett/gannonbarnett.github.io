Gannon Barnett
--------------
I'm currently a student of MIT 2022 majoring in computer science, concentrating in Mandarin Chinese, and exploring a minor in management. I love to code and design. I also enjoy outdoor sports like soccer, running, tennis, and golf. I grew up in Newton MA and Sunapee NH. I was a dedicated lightweight rower for 6 years and medaled twice at US nationals and once at Head of the Charles. My life-long goal is to be a software entreprenuer and make a meaningful and productive product. 

I found my passion for coding in my senior year of highschool. I was lucky enough to get into college my senior Fall, and I was already taking a light course load due to being a year ahead in math and physics. These combined left me with a lot of time outside of school and crew, which I largely dedicated to getting into mobile app development. 

I was immediately attracted to mobile app development because of how accessible it made my code to users. I took computer science in class, but using the code I wrote was always restricted by running it in an IDE. Mobile apps allowed me to deliver my projects to users, and I found that incredibly satisfying. 

After building a few mobile applications (see my articles on SitReady, Rough Riderz, and The Watt Farm App), I arrived at MIT and was interested in applying my mobile skills wherever possible. I found a startup called Instacam through the Martin Trust Center, and helped them build a video streaming app using WebRTC. In January 2019 I joined Rentingway, where I was the sole developer for 9 months, during which I built the backend for messaging, payment, and newsfeed/social media services. I'm still working part-time for Rentingway now. Check us out at rentingway.com. 

In school I'm exploring various software systems and machine learning courses with a taste of economics/probability/management courses. To get in contact with me please reach out through LinkedIn or email me (Gannon Barnett) at:
